# **Clarification: Why `app::event` Works for the `event` Function?**

## **1. The Core Doubt**

In the Calimero SDK, we define a function:

```rust
pub fn event(args: TokenStream, input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream
```

However, this function is invoked as `#[app::event]`, which makes it appear as if it's in an `app` namespace.

## **2. Is `app` a Module?**

Yes, `app` is a **module** in Rust. While it behaves similarly to a **namespace** in other languages like C++, the correct Rust terminology is "module." Modules in Rust organize code and provide paths for accessing items (functions, macros, structs, etc.).

In this case, the `app` module is defined in the SDK as:

```rust
pub mod app {
    pub use calimero_sdk_macros::{destroy, emit, event, init, logic, state};
}
```

This means `app` is a module that re-exports several macros (including `event`) for use with a consistent `app::` prefix.

### **Comparison to C++ Namespaces**

In C++:

```cpp
namespace app {
    void event();
}
using app::event;
```

This is similar in concept, but in Rust, the `app` module serves as the equivalent of a **namespace**, and re-exporting allows items to be accessed cleanly.

## **3. Is `event` a Macro, a Function, or Both?**

`event` is a **procedural macro**, which is implemented as a function but invoked like a macro. Here's how:

### **a) Procedural Macro Function**

The `event` function is defined in the SDK as:

```rust
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn event(args: TokenStream, input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream
```

- It is a **Rust function** annotated with `#[proc_macro_attribute]`, meaning it operates as a procedural macro.
- The procedural macro system **calls this function at compile time** when it encounters `#[app::event]`.

Without the `#[proc_macro_attribute]` annotation, `event` would simply be a regular Rust function, but it would not have the ability to transform annotated code at compile-time. The annotation tells the Rust compiler to treat `event` as a macro entry point.

### **b) Invoked as a Macro**

When you write:

```rust
#[app::event]
pub enum MyEvent {
    // ...
}
```

Rust invokes the `event` function behind the scenes, transforming the annotated code based on the logic in the function.

### **Why This Dual Nature Matters**

- To the developer, `#[app::event]` appears as a macro because it operates on annotated code.
- Internally, itâ€™s implemented as a function that transforms the input code.

### **Comparison to C++ Macros**

- In C++, preprocessor macros (`#define`) are purely text substitutions. Rust macros, however, work at the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) level, making them much more powerful and safer.
- A Rust procedural macro is closer to a **templated function** in C++ but operates at compile-time.

## **4. Key Takeaways**

- **`app` is a module**, not technically a namespace, but it serves a similar organizational role.
- `event` is a **function** marked as a **procedural macro**, meaning it transforms annotated code at compile-time.
- The `#[proc_macro_attribute]` annotation is critical for turning `event` into a macro; without it, `event` would just be a regular function.
- The `app::event` syntax is enabled by **module re-exporting**, making macros accessible with a clean and consistent prefix.
