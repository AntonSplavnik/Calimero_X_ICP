# Understanding Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Blockchains

## Layer 1 (Base Layer)

### Definition

A Layer 1 blockchain is an independent blockchain network that:

- Handles its own security
- Validates its own transactions
- Maintains its own consensus
- Has its own native token

### Examples

```
Bitcoin:                Ethereum:
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│ Full Network │       │ Full Network │
│ Consensus    │       │ Consensus    │
│ Security     │       │ Security     │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

### Characteristics

1. **Independence**

   - Own validator network
   - Complete security model
   - Independent consensus
   - Self-contained system

2. **Complexity**
   - Must solve all blockchain challenges
   - Needs robust security
   - Requires significant resources
   - Complex consensus mechanisms

## Layer 2 (Scaling Layer)

### Definition

A Layer 2 is a blockchain that operates on top of a Layer 1, where:

- Security is inherited from L1
- Transactions are bundled/settled on L1
- Consensus is simplified
- Can focus on specific features

### Structure

```
Layer 2:
┌────────────────────┐
│ Optimized Features │
│ Block Production   │
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │
Layer 1:  v
┌────────────────────┐
│ Security/Settlement│
│ Base Consensus     │
└────────────────────┘
```

### Characteristics

1. **Efficiency**

   - Faster transactions
   - Lower costs
   - Specialized features
   - Simpler consensus

2. **Security Model**
   - Inherits L1 security
   - Focuses on performance
   - Regular state commitments
   - Fraud proofs

## Key Differences

### 1. Security

- **L1**: Must provide its own security
- **L2**: Inherits security from base layer

### 2. Consensus

- **L1**: Full consensus mechanism
- **L2**: Simplified consensus for ordering

### 3. Scalability

- **L1**: Limited by network capacity
- **L2**: Can optimize for throughput

### 4. Complexity

```
L1 Requirements:        L2 Requirements:
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│ Consensus    │       │ Ordering     │
│ Security     │       │ Throughput   │
│ Networking   │       │ State Commits │
│ Governance   │       │ Bridge Logic  │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```
